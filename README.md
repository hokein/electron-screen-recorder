# Electron Screen Recorder

This is an electron-based screen recorder application. It uses WebRTC and
[`desktopCapture`](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/desktop-capturer.md#desktopcapturer) API for audio/video recording.

You can choose a specific screen/window to record, and the record file is saved
as `webm`.
